# Products Management System

This repository contains a project for a Products Management System implemented using Vanilla JavaScript. The system allows users to create, read, update, and delete products. Additionally, it provides functionality to add bulk products and search for products by title or category.

## Features

1. **Create**: Users can create new products by providing the necessary details such as title, category, price, and description. The system validates the input and adds the product to the list.

2. **Read**: Users can view the list of products, including their titles, categories, prices, and descriptions. The system displays the products in a user-friendly format.

3. **Update**: Users can update the details of existing products. They can modify the title, category, price, or description of a product. The system ensures the validity of the changes and updates the product accordingly.

4. **Delete**: Users can delete products from the system. They can select a product from the list and remove it, ensuring that it is no longer available in the system.

5. **Bulk Adding**: The system provides functionality to add a bulk set of products at once. Users can import a CSV or Excel file containing product data, and the system will parse and add the products to the list.

6. **Search**: Users can search for products by their title or category. The system allows users to enter a search term and displays the matching products. It enables quick and easy retrieval of specific products based on user preferences.
